# basic-page

This is a recreation of The Odin Project landing page project. The page I have created is by eye from the images given in the project but using the fonts, font sizes and colors specified during the project.

The idea of this project is to recreate the page however there is no requirement to be pixel perfect, the general layout and feel of the page is to be recreated.

The original image can be found here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png

The font and colour spec can be found here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png
